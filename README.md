## Disclaimer

I am not an epidemiologist so I can’t guarantee 100% that the scenarios above will become reality. I believe the visualizations would help explaining the impact of “social distancing” and through that, I want to emphasize that everyone plays an important role here in this pandemic.

Please keep in mind that this is a simple SEIR+DH model and the available data used to train the model was limited in the moment of writing the article. 

Furthermore, I hope this will inspire people to explore more on the numbers and models beside sticking to just mainstream medias and potentially not-so-reliable news.

Please refer to the Jupyter notebook for the codes https://github.com/o0oBluePhoenixo0o/COVID_19-Social-Dist-Simulation/blob/master/COVID-19%20Social%20Dist%20Simulator%20Modeling.ipynb
